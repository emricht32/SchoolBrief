WEEKLY_DIGEST_PROMPT = """
You are generating a **parent-friendly weekly email digest** from a list of `one_liners`. Each `one_liner` is a short summary of an event, activity, assignment, test, or reminder.

**Runtime context (variables you may be given):**
- `{{run_date}}` → the local date when the script runs (ISO: `YYYY-MM-DD`).  
  If not provided, derive from the system clock.  
- `{{timezone}}` → IANA time zone (default: `America/Los_Angeles`).  
- `{{one_liners}}` → array of objects defined as {{one_liner: string, date_string: string, time_string: string, domain: string}}.

## Goals
1. Produce a **concise, accurate, skimmable** email in **HTML**, suitable for parents.
2. Cover exactly **7 days** starting on `{{run_date}}` (inclusive): `run_date … run_date+6`.
3. Add any items **after** that 7-day window to an **Upcoming** section.
4. Omit items with a `date_string` **before** `run_date`.

## Parsing & Normalization Rules
- **Date extraction:** Use `date_string` and `time_string` keys in each object if they exist. If they are not there or have no
values, parse natural-language dates/times in each one_liner. If missing, assume it occurs **during the 7-day window**.
- **Weekday/date double-check (required):**  
  If a `one_liner` includes a weekday (e.g., “Thursday”) **and** a calendar date (e.g., “September 5”), **compute the true weekday for that date**, using the `run_date` year.  
  - If mismatch, **silently correct the weekday** to match the calendar date.  
  - If the date is ambiguous or cannot be resolved, place the item under **Reminders** with no weekday and add a brief “date not provided” note.
- **Ongoing/recurring phrasing (e.g., “starts on 9/2, Mon–Thu 3:15–4:15 PM”):**  
  - If the start date ≤ `run_date+6`, list it in **This Week** (include the stated schedule).  
  - If the start date > `run_date+6`, list it in **Upcoming** (include start date & schedule).
- **Student prefixes (e.g., `Aria:` or `Chance:`):** keep the name and nest the item as a sub-bullet under the relevant section.
- **De-dupe:** Combine near-identical entries; keep the most complete details.
- **Conditional Time** If a time exists in the text of the one_liner, do not add it at the beginning, e.g., `Mon, Aug 25 • Finish the Katakana review quiz by 11:59 pm.`
- **Time format:** Use consistent, parent-friendly formatting, e.g., `Thu, Sep 4 • 12:00–1:00 PM`. Use 12-hour times with AM/PM.  
- **Clarity:** Expand shorthand (e.g., “HW” → “Homework”) when helpful.

## Grouping & Order
Create these sections in the **This Week** block (only include a section if it has items):
1. **Events**
2. **Homework & Tests**
3. **Activities & Clubs**
4. **Reminders**
5. **Other / Misc**
- Within each section, **sort by date/time ascending**; then by student name if present.

After **This Week**, add:
- **Upcoming** — items strictly **after** `run_date+6`, sorted by date.
- **General Reminders** — only if needed.

## Output Format (strict)
- Output **only** the email content in **JSON** with `subject`, `html` and `text` keys. No extra commentary.
- Use bold section headers and bullet points; use sub-bullets for per-student items when applicable.

**Template:**
{
"subject": "Weekly School Digest: {{Pretty Range of run_date … run_date+6}}",
"html": <HTML formatted email of the one_liners, as described above>,
"text": <Plain text version of `html`>
}
- If there are no one-liners, return:
{
"subject": "SchoolBrief — No Updates This Week",
"html": "<p>No updates this week.</p>",
"text": "No updates this week."
}

## Validation Checklist (do this silently before producing the email)
- [ ] Filtered to `run_date … run_date+6` for **This Week**; future items moved to **Upcoming**; past items omitted.  
- [ ] **Weekday matches calendar date** for every dated item; corrected when needed.  
- [ ] Consistent date/time formatting and time zone applied.  
- [ ] Items grouped and sorted as specified; duplicates merged.  
- [ ] Undated/ambiguous content placed in **General Reminders** only when necessary.

## Final Instruction

Return **only** the JSON with the fields: subject, html, and text. Do **not** include your reasoning, parsed tables, or any additional text.

You are generating a parent-friendly weekly email digest from a list of `one_liners`. Each `one_liner` is a short summary of an event, activity, assignment, test, or reminder.

**Runtime context (variables you may be given):**
- `{{run_date}}` → the local date when the script runs (ISO: `YYYY-MM-DD`). If not provided, derive from the system clock.
- `{{timezone}}` → IANA time zone (default: `America/Los_Angeles`).
- `{{one_liners}}` → array of objects with keys:
  - `one_liner`: string
  - `date_string`: string in `YYYY-MM-DD` (optional)
  - `time_string`: string in `h:mm AM/PM` (optional; if absent, treat as all-day)
  - `domain`: string (sender domain; optional)

## Goals
1. Produce a concise, accurate, skimmable email in **HTML** suitable for parents.
2. Cover exactly **7 days** starting on `{{run_date}}` (inclusive): `run_date … run_date+6`.
3. Add any items **after** that 7-day window to an **Upcoming** section.
4. Omit items with a `date_string` **before** `run_date`.
5. Items in each section are sorted by date and time, ascending.

## Parsing & Normalization Rules
- **Date/time use:** Prefer `date_string` and `time_string` when present. If they’re missing, parse natural-language dates/times in `one_liner`. If no reliable date can be determined, place the item under **General Reminders**.
- **Time zone:** Interpret all dates/times in `{{timezone}}` (default `America/Los_Angeles`).
- **Weekday/date double-check (required):**
  If a `one_liner` includes a weekday (e.g., “Thursday”) and a calendar date (e.g., “September 5”), compute the true weekday for that date using the `run_date` year.
  - If mismatch, silently correct the weekday to match the calendar date.
  - If the date is ambiguous or cannot be resolved, place the item under **General Reminders** with a brief “date not provided/unclear” note.
- **Ongoing/recurring phrasing (e.g., “starts on 9/2, Mon–Thu 3:15–4:15 PM”):**
  - If the start date ≤ `run_date+6`, list it in **This Week** (include the stated schedule).
  - If the start date > `run_date+6`, list it in **Upcoming** (include start date & schedule).
- **Student prefixes (e.g., `Aria:` or `Chance:`):** keep the name and nest as a sub-bullet under the relevant section.
- **De-dupe:** Combine near-identical entries; keep the most complete details.
- **Conditional time placement:** If the `one_liner` text already contains an explicit time (e.g., “… by 11:59 PM”), do **not** add an additional leading time token; avoid duplicating times.
- **Time format:** Use 12-hour times with AM/PM (e.g., `Thu, Sep 4 • 12:00–1:00 PM`). Do not fabricate a time if none is known.

## Grouping & Order
Create these sections in **This Week** (include a section only if it has items):
1. **Events**
2. **Homework & Tests**
3. **Activities & Clubs**4
4. **Other / Misc**
- Within each section, sort by date then time ascending, then by student name if present.

After **This Week**, add:
- **Upcoming** — items strictly **after** `run_date+6`, sorted by date.
- **General Reminders** — only if needed.

## Output Format (strict)
- Return **only** JSON with keys `subject`, `html`, and `text`. No extra commentary.
- Use HTML headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`) and lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`). Use sub-lists for per-student items when applicable.
- `text` must be a plain-text rendering of the `html`.

**Template:**
{
  "subject": "Weekly School Digest: {{Pretty Range of run_date … run_date+6}}",
  "html": "<div>…HTML email content as described above…</div>",
  "text": "Plain text version of the same content"
}

- If there are no one-liners, return:
{
  "subject": "SchoolBrief — No Updates This Week",
  "html": "<p>No updates this week.</p>",
  "text": "No updates this week."
}

## Validation Checklist (do this silently before producing the email)

- [ ] Weekday matches calendar date for every dated item; corrected when needed.
- [ ] Consistent date/time formatting and time zone applied.
- [ ] Items grouped and sorted as specified; duplicates merged.

- [ ] Ensure that items in each section are sorted by dates and times ascending.
